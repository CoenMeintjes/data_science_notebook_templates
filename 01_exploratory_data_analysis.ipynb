    "1. **Label encoding |** Data transformation technique where each category is assigned a unique number instead of a qualitative value\n",
    "\n",
    "Some potential problems with label encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you’re analyzing a dataset with categories of music genres. You label encode “Blues,” “Electronic Dance Music (EDM),” “Hip Hop,” “Jazz,” “K-Pop,” “Metal,” “ and “Rock,” with the following numeric values, “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.” \n",
    "\n",
    "With this label encoding, the resulting machine learning model could derive not only a ranking, but also a closer connection between Blues (1) and EDM (2) because of how close they are numerically than, say, Blues(1) and Jazz(4). In addition to these presumed relationships (which you may or may not want in your analysis) you should also notice that each code is equidistant from the other in the numeric sequence, as in 1 to 2 is the same distance as 5 to 6, etc. The question is, does that equidistant relationship accurately represent the relationships between the music genres in your dataset? To ask another question, after encoding, will the visualization or model you build treat the encoded labels as a ranking? \n",
    "\n",
    "The same could be said for the mushroom example above. After label encoding mushroom types, are you satisfied with the fact that the mushrooms are now in a presumed ranked order with button mushrooms ranked first and toadstool ranked eighth? \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, label encoding may introduce unintended relationships between the categorical data in your dataset. When you are making decisions about label encoding, consider the algorithm you’ll apply to the data and how it may or may not impact label encoded categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **One-hot encoding |** Uses *Dummy Variables* with values of 0 or 1, which indicated the presence of absence of something.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this method, we solve the problem of the unintended and problematic relationships that label encoding presented. \n",
    "\n",
    "But one-hot encoding does present its own set of problems, particularly when it comes to logistic and linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Label encoding or one-hot encoding: How to decide?** \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no simple answer to whether you should use label encoding or one-hot encoding. The decision needs to be made on a case-by-case, or dataset-by-dataset basis. But there are some guidelines to help you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use label encoding when:\n",
    "- There are a large number of different categorical variables — because label encoding uses far less data than one-hot encoding\n",
    "- The categorical values have a particular order to them (for example, age groups can be grouped as youngest to oldest or oldest to youngest)\n",
    "- You plan to use a decision tree or random forest machine learning model\n",
    "\n",
    "Use one-hot encoding when: \n",
