    "#### 2.1 Structure of a Decision Tree\n",
    "Decision trees are made of nodes. Nodes are groups of samples. There are different types of nodes, depending on how they function in the tree. The first node in a decision tree is called the **root node**. The first split always comes off of the root node, which divides the samples into two new nodes based on the values they contain for a particular feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two new nodes are referred to as **child nodes** of the root. A child node is any node that results from a split. The node that the child splits from is known as the **parent node.** Each of these two new child nodes in turn splits the data again, based on a new criterion. This process continues until the nodes stop splitting. The bottom-level nodes that do not split are called **leaf nodes**. All the nodes above the leaf nodes are called **decision nodes**, because they all make a decision that sorts the data either to the left or to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Decisions and Splits\n",
    "In a decision tree, the data is split and passed down through decision nodes until reaching a leaf node. A decision node is split on the criterion that minimizes the impurity of the classes in their resulting children.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.2.1 Categorical variables\n",
    "If the predictor variable is categorical, the decision tree algorithm will consider splitting based on category.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.2.2 Continuous variables\n",
    "If the predictor variable is continuous, splits can be made anywhere along the range of numbers that exist in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 Choosing splits: Gini Impurity\n",
    "There are several possible metrics to use to determine the purity of a node and to decide how to split, including Gini impurity, entropy, information gain, and log loss. The most straightforward is Gini impurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gini impurity of a node is defined as: $\\text{Gini Impurity} = 1 - \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}P(i)^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "- where $i$= class\n",
    "- $P(i)$ = the probability of samples belonging to class $i$ in a given node\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gini impurity is calculated for each child node of each potential split point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.4 Advantages and Disadvantages of Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Require relatively few pre-processing steps\n",
    "- Can work easily with all types of variables (continuous, categorical, discrete)\n",
    "- Do not require normalization or scaling\n",
    "- Decisions are transparent\n",
    "- Not affected by extreme univariate values\n",
    "\n",

    "Model validation is the set of processes and activities intended to verify that models are performing as expected. Model validation refers to the whole process of evaluating different models, selecting one, and then continuing to analyze the performance of the selected model to better understand its strengths and limitations. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 Validation Sets \n",
    "The simplest way to maintain the objectivity of the test data is to create another partition in the data—a validation set—and save the test data for after you select the final model. The validation set is then used, instead of the test set, to compare different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a model using a separate validation set, once the final model is selected, best practice is to go back and fit the selected model to all the non-test data (i.e., the training data + validation data) before scoring this final model on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2 Cross Validation \n",
    "Cross Validation is a process that uses different portions of the data to test and train a model on different iterations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation makes more efficient use of the training data by splitting the training data into k number of “folds” (partitions), training a model on k – 1 folds, and using the fold that was held out to get a validation score. The training process occurs k times, each time using a different fold as the validation set. At the end, the final validation score is the average of all k scores. This process is also commonly referred to as k-fold cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a model is selected using cross-validation, that selected model is then refit to the entire training set (i.e., it’s retrained on all k folds combined).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation reduces the likelihood of significant divergence of the distributions in the validation data from those in the full dataset. For this reason, it’s often the preferred technique when working with smaller datasets, which are more susceptible to randomness. The more folds you use, the more thorough the validation. However, adding folds increases the time needed to train, and may not be useful beyond a certain point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3 Model Selection\n",
    "Once candidate models have been trained and validated a champion model is selected. Model validation scores factor heavily into this selection but score is seldom the only criterion. Often other factors are also considered. \n",
    "- How explainable is the model? \n",
    "- How complex is it? \n",
    "- How resilient is it against fluctuations in input values? \n",
    "- How well does it perform on data not found in the training data? \n",
    "- How much computational cost does it have to make predictions? \n",
    "- Does it add much latency to any production system? \n",
    "It’s not uncommon for a model with a slightly lower validation score to be selected over the highest-scoring model due to it being simpler, less computationally expensive, or more stable.\n"
